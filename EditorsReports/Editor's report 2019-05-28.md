# Editors' report

Laurence J. Golding and Michael Fanning

This report describes the Editors' response to the comments that were received from the TC during the e-ballot period.

1. Yekaterina O'Neil commented:

    > 3.15.3: "which take up a large among of space" -> "which take up a large amount of space"

    I will fix this non-substantive issue after the public comment period.

    > 3.24.6: roles are not alphabetized -- is this the intent?

    It was intentional to list the file-change-related roles (`"added"`, `"deleted"`, _etc._) separately. But within those categories, I should have alphabetized.

    I will fix this non-substantive issue after the public comment period.

    I filed [Issue #423](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/423), "Ballot comments from Yekaterina: typo and alphabetized roles".

2. James A. Kupsch commented:

    > `tool.extensions[]` should be teated the same as `tool.driver` for the case of external property files. I am OK with not fixing this in version 2.1. In the next version of SARIF the `tool` property should be reworked to improve this and other inefficiencies with the `tool` object and `toolComponent` objects.

    Since Jim does not object to the spec as it stands for Version 2.1, there is no action at this time.

    I filed [Issue #424](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/424), "Improve efficiency of tool and toolComponent objects", and labeled it `future`.
