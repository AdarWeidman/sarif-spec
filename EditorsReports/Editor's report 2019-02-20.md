1. [Issue #260](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/260): "Create set of general icon types for review by TC"

    Closed in favor of [Issue #202](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/202),
    which defines a set of "well-known" thread flow location kinds that viewers can
    use as hints to display relevant icons.
