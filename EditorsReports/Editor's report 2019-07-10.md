All the changes are bug fixes which we are making at editorial discretion. In the opinion of the Editors, there are no substantive changes.
We will discuss whether [Issue #429](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/429) is a substantive change or whether it is (as the Editors believe)
a clarification of an obvious point.
